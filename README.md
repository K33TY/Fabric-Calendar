# Fabric-Calendar

A calendar web app demo built for a distributed architecture which enforces information flow policies. 

What is this:
```java
public static final byte[] $classHash = new byte[] { -114, 66, -37, -57, -7,
    99, 44, 92, 112, 100, -51, 59, -86, -8, 110, 96, -20, 96, -117, 104, 119,
    60, -34, 19, 32, -55, -31, -94, -78, 79, 57, -12 };
```
