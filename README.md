# Fabric-Calendar

A calendar web app demo built for a distributed architecture which enforces information flow policies. 

## Building the Application
The application will not build unless you first configure the `build.properties` file in `etc,` which you 
should set to your path to `$FABRIC`


## Work in progress - Questions:
What kind of policy do we want for the session actions to work correctly? Had not thought about this until 
yesterday/today when finally able to get past a few compiler bugs that led me to these bugs...

## Prior questions:

Are keystores autogenerated?

Questions regarding the persistence of store objects, what happens when the store is turned off. 
How does the java object retain its state? Or is this object in essence completely something else? I'm not familiar 
with the BerkelyDB



What is the property: ```fabric.dissemination.pastry.pastry_socket_allow_loopback=true```
