# Fabric-Calendar

A calendar web app demo built for a distributed architecture which enforces information flow policies. 


## Work in progress - Questions:

Are keystores autogenerated?

Questions regarding the persistence of store objects, what happens when the store is turned off. 
How does the java object retain its state? Or is this object in essence completely something else? I'm not familiar 
with the BerkelyDB



What is the property: ```fabric.dissemination.pastry.pastry_socket_allow_loopback=true```
