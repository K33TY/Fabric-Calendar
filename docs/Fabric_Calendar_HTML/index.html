                This site's main purpose will be to walk a new user through the different steps of creating a basic
                Fabric application. <br /> <br />

                This is not meant to be a replacement for the <a href="https://www.cs.cornell.edu/projects/fabric/manual/0.3.0/html/">
                Fabric manual</a>, but supplementary material of a more hands-on nature.

            <div id="calendar">
                <h2>Calendar Example</h2>

                A calendar application was written in Fabric's precursor language, Jif. This prior calendar, based on
                Jif's language capabilities, was not distributed. Porting the calendar to the Fabric language meant
                requiring an overhaul to the architecture. <br /><br />

                The original calendar implemented a mySQL database to achieve persistence, and setting up the database
                was a requirement for running the application. The actions for the calendar required accessing the database
                by authorized principals (calendar users). However, in the Fabric language, there is an object implemented
                with the intention of serving as a persistent database. This object, the store, follows the many new
                distributed design decisions implemented in the Fabric language. <br /><br />

                Now, instead of implementing a database, and using database calls to achieve the functionality in the
                calendar, we simply need to ensure that a storage node is running somewhere with the persistent features
                required by the calendar. In essence, this storage node acts as the top principal with the greatest label
                {&#8868;→&#8868;;&#8868;←&#8868;}, allowing the storage to perform all actions on any calendar in an
                active user session. <br /><br />

                A worker node is spun up for any individual user wanting to access the calendar. This follows the Fabric
                language premise which states that objects do not "instantiate" but rather join the overall "Fabric."
                The worker node, therefore should allow a user to either join the calendar (a future wanted capability)
                or authenticate a session if they have already joined the calendar previously. With both of these actions,
                we are able to use Fabric's idea of remote calls, accessing the storage node by invoking appropriate
                methods at the store. <br /><br />

                Adding a user is a feature that would be nice to implement, and may become another method with the least
                label that the store allows. Of course, the store will check that the username is valid and not already
                in use, especially considering the username is operating as a user-id, or key, for access to all of the
                user's objects within their calendar. At this point, we shall first hard-code this functionality until
                the other portions of the calendar are implemented.<br /><br />

                In the case of authentication, we do not care about the latency for authentication happening over the
                wire since this would be no different if we had to do the same task via a SQL database access. At this
                point, the worker node is completely untrusted, having the least label {&#8869;→&#8869;;&#8869;←&#8869;}.
                The store allows a singular remote call to operate with this security label, namely a method which allows
                the store to receive input from the user at the given worker node. If the user provides a valid username
                and password combination, then the store will delegate the confidentiality and integrity permissions of
                that user to the active session represented by the worker node. Furthermore, it will use the Fabric's
                language feature of data shipping, and cache all objects at the worker node relating to the authenticated
                user.  <br /><br />
